# Microsoft Acess Licenses
To access server software legally, a *Client Access License* (CAL) may be required. A CAL is not a software product, rather, it is a license that gives a user the right to access the services of the server.
For using management software such as Microsoft System Center, a *Management License* (ML) may be required for the device being managed.
