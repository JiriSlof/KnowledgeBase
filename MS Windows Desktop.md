## License Types
Microsoft offers various licensing types to accommodate the diverse needs of users and organizations.

### Retail Licenses
A full Packaged Product (FPP) is the retail version of a Microsoft licensed product.
Ideal for small businesses or individual users requiring a one-time purchase of Microsoft Office products.
A "Retail" license refers to the one you acquire when purchasing a copy of Windows from your local store or an online retailer. The Windows Retail license and product key can be transfered to another computer as long as you deactivate the old device.

#### Retail License Availability (per device)
- Windows 11 Home / Pro
- Windows 10 Home / Pro

### OEM Licenses (per device)
Come pre-installed on new hardware, offering a cost-effective solution for those purchasing new devices.

#### OEM License Availability (per device)
- Windows 11 Home / Pro
- Windows 10 Home / Pro

### Volume Licenses
Tailored for organizations that need to purchase licenses in bulk, providing flexibility and potential cost savings.

A "Volume" license is designed for large businesses, education, and government entities. Usually, a volume license allows organizations to use one master product key to activate any installation of Windows.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> - *Licenses that are purchased through the volume licensing agreements are upgrade licenses only.*
> - *There needs to be a quialifying operating system already on device, before volume license can be assigned to it.*
> - *The only exception is that customers can acquire the Windows VDA license to remotely access Windows 11 running in a virtual environment regardless of whether the user’s device has a Qualifying Operating System or not.*
